This is a redo of practice challenges from Le Wagon's front-end section of the full-stack web development course.

## Copy-cat Challenge

We were tasked to look at Dribbble and do a copy-cat of the design that we chose.

The design is created by [Brave Wings](https://dribbble.com/shots/6131920/attachments/6131920-Employee-page?mode=media).
